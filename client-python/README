Additional prerequisites needed for python client:

cython
tensorflow

We provide a brief guide to install tensorflow.

Install Anaconda Python: https://www.continuum.io/downloads
After installation, make sure the command "which python" and "which pip" points to the anaconda directory.
Enter the following command:

pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.8.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl

To test, type "import tensorflow" in python. If the import worked fine, you're good to go!

After installation of tensorflow and cython, run "make" before running main.py.
